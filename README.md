# NextJS Portfolio with Sophisticated Microinteractions

> **🎯 Status**: Foundation complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation (Apple Liquid Glass effects)

A personal portfolio built on NextJS featuring sophisticated microinteractions, Apple's 2025 Liquid Glass effects, and subtle computer science expertise indicators. Transformed from an audio/LLM application while preserving the exact minimalist design aesthetic.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Sophisticated Minimalism**: Layer advanced interactions over clean design without overwhelming simplicity. Every microinteraction demonstrates technical prowess while maintaining visual elegance.

**Apple Liquid Glass Integration**: Implementing Apple's cutting-edge 2025 design system with translucent materials, real-time backdrop blur, and adaptive opacity.

**CS Expertise Signals**: Subtle algorithmic patterns, performance-aware systems, and mathematical precision that tacitly convey programming competence.
